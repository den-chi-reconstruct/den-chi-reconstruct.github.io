<p>May 25, 1995</p>
<p>The Administration Bureau for Industry and Commerce and Foreign Economic and Trade Commissions (Departments or Bureaus) of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and cities under separate state planning, and Foreign Economic and Trade Commissions of Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shantou:</p>
<p>Article 11 of Circular on Relevant Issues in Respect of Further Strengthening the Examination and Approval, Registration and Administration of Foreign Investment Enterprise (Gong Shang Qi Zi [1994] No. 305), issued by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on Nov. 3, 1994, provides that "during the operating period, a foreign investment enterprise may, without prejudice to the normal operation of the enterprise and to the interests of creditors, apply to the original examination and approval authority for reducing the business scope and adjusting the total investment amount and registered capital on the ground of reasonable reasons. Upon the approval of the original examination and approval authority and the original registration authority, the foreign-invested enterprise may go through the amendments registration which shall be filed to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce for archival." According to the Company Law of the People's Republic of China and other relevant laws, regulations and the aforesaid provisions, relevant provisions and procedures for foreign investment enterprises (hereinafter referred to as "enterprises") applying for adjusting the total investment amount and registered capital are hereby notified as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 No enterprise may apply for adjusting total investment amount or registered capital in any of the following cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the minimum registered capital is provided by laws and regulations in effect, and the registered capital after the adjustment is less than the amount of statutory capital;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the enterprise is involved in economic disputes, which are under judicial or arbitration procedure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the minimum production and operation scope is stipulated in contracts or the Articles of Association by the enterprise and the total capital amount after the adjustment is less than such provided minimum scope; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where a Sino-foreign cooperative joint venture stipulates in the contract that the foreign party may recover its investment prior to the expiration of the contract, and such recovery has been completed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 2 Detailed procedure of applying for adjusting the total investment amount and registered capital:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Detailed procedures for enterprises needing to apply for adjusting the total investment amount and registered capital:</p>
</li>

The enterprise shall notify creditors within ten (10) days and make public notices at least three times on any newspaper above the provincial level within thirty (30) days after receiving the initial reply made by the original approval authority in respect of approving of the enterprise adjusting the total investment amount and the registered capital. The right of demanding the enterprise to settle debts or offer relevant securities shall remain with creditors that received notifications within thirty (30) days as of receiving notifications and creditors without notifications within ninety (90) days as of the first public notice date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the three (3) public notices, the enterprise shall submit to the original examination and approval authority the certification of such public notices in respect of reducing the registered capital and the statement of the settlement of debts or the situation of securities for debts. The original examination and approval authority shall make a decision stating the approval or non-approval within thirty (30) days after receiving the aforesaid documents. A copy of the approval decision made by the original examination and approval authority shall be simultaneously sent to administration bureaus for industry and commerce, taxation, customs or other relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Where an enterprise's application for adjusting the total investment amount and registered capital is approved by the original examination and approval authority, the enterprise shall, within thirty (30) days after such approval, go through procedures of amendments registration in the original administration authority for industry and commerce according to regulations, and shall file such amendments registration to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce for archival. If the amount of imported equipments, raw materials and other items with the exempt from tax in the original investment amount is less than the total investment amount after adjustment, the enterprise shall report such situation to the Customs for the verification in respect of paying relevant taxes.</p>
