                <p>Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Incomes from Equity Transfers of Non-Resident Enterprises</p>
<p>Guo Shui Han [2009] No. 698</p>
<p>December 10, 2009</p>
<p>To the state taxation bureaus and local taxation bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and cities specifically designated in the state plan:</p>
<p>For the purposes of regulating and strengthening the administration of enterprise income tax on income from non-resident enterprises' equity transfers and in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprise Income Tax and its implementing rules, the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of Tax Levying and its implementing rules, the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Printing and Distributing of the Interim Administrative Measures for Source Withholding and Remittance of Non-Resident Enterprise Income Tax (Guo Shui Fa[2009] No.3) and the Circular of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Treatment of Enterprise Income Tax on the Enterprises' Restructuring Business (Cai Shui [2009] No. 59), relevant issues are hereby notified as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 For the purpose of this Circular, "equity transfer income" refers to the income obtained by the non-resident enterprises from their transfers of the equity of Chinese resident enterprises (excluding the stocks of Chinese resident enterprises that are purchased from and sold in the open securities markets).</p>
<p>Article 2 Where the withholding agent fails to withhold legally or is impossible to perform the withholding obligation, the non-resident enterprise in question shall file tax return and pay the enterprise income tax to the competent tax authorities at the locality of the Chinese resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred (such tax authorities shall be responsible for the tax collection and administration of the income tax of such resident enterprise) within seven (7) days upon the date of equity transfer as agreed in relevant contracts and/or agreements (where the transferring party obtains the equity transfer income in advance, the date of actual obtaining of equity transfer income shall prevail). Where the non-resident enterprise fails to file tax return on time and/or according to the facts, the relevant regulations of the taxation collection and administration laws shall be referred to for handling of the same.</p>
<p>Article 3 The equity transfer income refers to the balance of the equity transfer price deducting the equity cost price.</p>
<p>The term "equity transfer price" refers to the amount received by equity transferor with respect to the transferred equity, which includes but not limited to case, non-monetary assets or rights and interests. Where the enterprise whose shares are being held has undistributed profit or after-tax reserved funds, the equity transferor shall transfer the amount of retained right to return on equity enjoyed by such shareholder together with the equity in question and may not deduct the same from the equity transfer price.</p>
<p>The term "equity cost price" refers to the amount of actual capital distributions paid by the equity transferor to the Chinese resident enterprise when making equity investment or equity transfer amount actually paid by the equity transferor to the original transferor of such equity to purchase such equity.</p>
<p>(Relevant articles: Q &amp; A 1 )</p>
<p>Article 4 The currency used when the non-resident enterprise invested into the Chinese resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred or purchased such equity from the original investing parties shall be used for the calculation of the equity transfer price and the equity cost price in terms of calculation of the equity transfer income. Where the same non-resident enterprise makes more than one investment, the currency used for the first capital investment shall be used for the calculation of equity transfer price and equity cost price and the weighted average method shall be adopted for the calculation of equity cost price; in case of different currency used for the investment(s) other than the first investment, the exchange rate at the date of every capital investment shall be adopted to convert the said different currency into the currency used for the first investment.</p>
<p>Article 5 Where the foreign investing party (who is the actual controlling party) indirectly transfers the equity of Chinese resident enterprise it held and if the country (or region) in which the transferred offshore holding company locates levies no taxation on the foreign income of its residents or levies taxation on the foreign income of its residents of a percentage lower than 12.5%, such foreign investing party shall provide the following material to the competent tax authorities at the locality of the Chinese resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred within thirty (30) days upon the conclusion of the equity transfer contract with respect thereto:</p>
<p>(1) equity transfer contract or agreement;</p>
<p>(2) the relationships between the foreign investing party and the offshore holding company it transferred with respect to the funds, operation, purchase and sale and other required aspects;</p>
<p>(3) the situation of the production, operation, personnel, finance, assets and other aspects of the offshore holding company transferred by the foreign investing party;</p>
<p>(4) the relationships between the offshore holding company transferred by the foreign investing party and the Chinese resident enterprise with respect to the funds, operation, purchase and sale and other required aspects;</p>
<p>(5) the statement of the reasonable commercial purpose for the establishment of the transferred offshore holding company by the foreign investing party; and</p>
<p>(6) other relevant materials as required by the taxation authorities.</p>
<p>Article 6 Where the foreign investing party (who is the actual controlling party) indirectly transfer the equity of the Chinese resident enterprise by arrangement such as abuse of the organization form for an unreasonable commercial purpose to evade the taxation obligation of paying the enterprise income tax, the competent tax authorities may, upon submitting the same to the State Administration of Taxation for examination, re-define the nature of such equity transfer transaction in accordance with the economic substance thereof and deny the existence of the offshore holding company(-ies) used for such taxation arrangement.</p>
<p>(Relevant articles: Legislation 1)</p>
<p>Article 7 Where the non-resident enterprise transfers the equity of a Chinese resident enterprise to its affiliate(s) and the transfer price thereof is not in consistent with the arm's length principle and thus the taxable income amount is reduced, the tax authorities shall have the right to adjust the same in light of reasonable methods.</p>
<p>Article 8 Where the foreign investing party (who is the actual controlling party) simultaneously transfers the equity of no less than two controlling companies home or abroad, the Chinese resident enterprise whose equity has been transferred shall submit the entire transfer contract and the step contract it involved to the competent taxation authorities. In case of no step contract, such Chinese resident enterprise shall submit the detailed material of all the controlling companies who have been transferred as a whole to the competent tax authorities and shall accurately categorize the transfer price of domestic transferred enterprise. In case of no accurate category, the competent tax authorities shall have the right to choose reasonable methods to adjust the transfer price.</p>
<p>Article 9 Where the non-resident enterprise selects the special taxation treatment when its obtaining of equity transfer income meets the special restructuring conditions as provided in the Cai Shui [2009] No. 59 Document, such non-resident enterprise shall submit the written material to the competent tax authorities for the record to proof that such special restructuring conditions have been met; and such special taxation treatment shall be subject to the approval of the tax authorities at the provincial level.</p>
<p>(Relevant articles: Legislation 1)</p>
<p>Article 10 This Circular shall come into effect on January 1, 2008. Any problem arising out of the implementation hereof is required to report to (the International Taxation Department of) the State Administration of Taxation.</p>
