<p>Subject to the approval of the examination and approval authority, a foreign investor may also use Renminbi profits derived from any other foreign investment enterprise it has established in the People's Republic of China as a capital contribution.</p>
<p>Article 26 Any machinery or equipment capitalized by a foreign investor according to its value shall be machinery or equipment required for production activities by the wholly foreign-owned enterprise concerned. </p>
<p>The value at which machinery or equipment is capitalized shall not exceed the current cost of the same kind of machinery or equipment on the international market. </p>
<p>A detailed list shall be made of all machinery and equipment that is capitalized according to its value. Such a list shall include the descriptions, types, quantities, assessed values, and other details concerning the machinery and equipment. The list shall be annexed to the application to establish the wholly foreign-owned enterprise and submitted to the examination and approval authority together with the application.</p>
<p>Article 27 Any industrial property or proprietary technology capitalized by a foreign investor according to its value shall be owned by the foreign investor concerned. </p>
<p>Detailed information shall be prepared concerning any industrial property or proprietary technology that is capitalized according to its value. Such information shall include copies of ownership documents and details on the validity of such documents, information on the technical functions and practical applications of the property or technology concerned, and the bases and standards used for assessing their values. The above information shall be annexed to the application to establish the wholly foreign-owned enterprise and submitted to the examination and approval authority together with the application.</p>
<p>Article 28 When machinery or equipment that has been capitalized according to its value arrives at a Chinese port, the wholly foreign-owned enterprise concerned shall request that a Chinese commodity inspection organization inspect the machinery or equipment.

<p>In the event of any discrepancy between the type, quality and quantity of machinery or equipment that has been capitalized according to its value and the type, quality and quantity of the machinery or equipment specified on the list of assets capitalized according to their value submitted by the foreign investor to the examination and approval authority, the examination and approval authority shall have the power to demand that the foreign investor rectify the discrepancy within a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Article 29 The examination and approval authority shall have the power to inspect industrial property or proprietary technology that has been capitalized according to its value after the use of such property or technology has commenced. In the event of any discrepancy between such industrial property or proprietary technology and the information originally supplied by the foreign investor, the examination and approval authority shall have the power to demand that the foreign investor rectify the discrepancy within a specified period of time.</p>
<p>Article 30 The period of time within which a foreign investor is to contribute its capital shall be specified in the application to establish the wholly foreign-owned enterprise and in the enterprise's Articles of association.</p>
<p>Chapter V Use of Land and Related Fees</p>

Land development work units may charge land development fees in a lump sum or by way of annual installments.</p>
<p>Article 36 Wholly foreign-owned enterprises that use undeveloped land may independently develop such land or engage appropriate Chinese work units to carry out such development work. The construction of infrastructure facilities shall be centrally managed by the local people's governments at the county level or above where wholly foreign-owned enterprises are located.</p>
<p>Article 37 The scales for rent and land development fees charged to wholly foreign-owned enterprises shall be set in accordance with the relevant provisions of China.</p>
<p>Article 38 The term of a land use right held by a wholly foreign-owned enterprise shall be the same as the operating period of the enterprise concerned.</p>
<p>Article 39 In addition to obtaining land use rights in accordance with this Chapter, wholly foreign-owned enterprises may obtain such rights pursuant to other laws and regulations of China.</p>
<p>Chapter VI Purchases and Sales</p>
<p>Article 40 Wholly foreign-owned enterprises shall have the right to decide on their own purchases of machinery, equipment, raw materials, fuel, spare parts, accessories, components, devices, means of transportation, office Articles and other items for their own use (hereinafter referred to as "physical goods").</p>
<p>Wholly foreign-owned enterprises that purchase physical goods in China shall, provided the parties have equal bargaining power, be granted terms equivalent to those enjoyed by Chinese enterprises.</p>
<p>Article 41 Wholly foreign-owned enterprises may sell their products on the Chinese market. The state encourages wholly foreign-owned enterprises to export their products.</p>

<p>Wholly foreign-owned enterprises may sell their own products in China or appoint a commercial organization to sell their products on their behalf.</p>
<p>Article 43 Where a foreign investor contributes as capital machinery or equipment for which China requires an import license, the wholly foreign-owned enterprise concerned shall, either directly or via an appointed agent, apply to the relevant licensing authority and obtain an import license on the basis of the enterprise's approved list of imported equipment and physical goods. </p>
<p>Where any wholly foreign-owned enterprise, within the scope of its approved business activities, imports physical goods required for its own production activities for which Chinese regulations require that an import license be obtained, the enterprise shall draw up an annual import plan for the relevant physical goods and shall apply to the relevant licensing authority once every six months to obtain an import license.</p>
